# My Personal Website
Link to App: http://odalysruano.com/

## App Description
OdalysRuano.com is a personal portfolio website I developed to showcase my career journey and experience as a full-stack software engineer. The main sections include "About Me", "Projects", "Resume", and "Contact". I utilized the Chakra UI framework, learning its comprehensive component library to design a modern, responsive interface. The entire site is built using TypeScript and React, allowing for strong type safety and scalable front-end development. The site is hosted using AWS services, with Route 53 managing domain routing, S3 providing static site hosting, and CodePipeline automating the deployment process.
