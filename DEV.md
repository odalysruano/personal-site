# How to Push to Prod:
This code base follows a simple prod deployment method. All changes can be seen locally via `npm start`.

In order to push to prod, make sure all commits have been uploaded to upstream, and run `npm run build`.

Commit those changes and upload those changes to upstream. Wait five minutes and your website should be updated.
